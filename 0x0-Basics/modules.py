# TODO: Import the math module, which contains features for working with math
import math

# TODO: The math module contains lots of pre-built functions
print("The square root of 16 is:", math.sqrt(16))

# TODO: In addition to functions, some modules contain useful constants
print("Pi is:", math.pi)

# TODO: Try some of the math functions for yourself here:
print("The value of 8 raised to power 3 is:", math.pow(8, 3))
